# All Stocks Analysis
Analysis of the data Steve needs to determine which green energy stocks would be the best ones for investment.

## Challenges Encountered
During this challenge there were a few obsticals that made it take longer than it should have:
- In Excel VBA's editor, it will often come up with a generic message stating that the value of an object or variable is out of range.  This can take time getting used to understanding how to find this error. Most likely some variable sent to determine a Cell on a worksheet is out of range either because it was not initialized. Another possibility is that the value went over the array boundaries.  In either case, the program will seem like it stopped running but if the stop button is not pressed the program will try to continue where it stopped and it will continue to fail. Once the stop button is pressed, the program will reset so it runs from the beginning with the updated code. This happened for a while where it was unclear why changes to the program did not take effect and took more time up than it should have.
